And then blogging....

[Why you should write daily?](http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/) A good writeup for inspiring me to start writing again.

Off late  I am really enjoying the writings of [Vaidy](https://twitter.com/_vaidy?lang=en), [CEO of Multunus](https://medium.com/@vaidy). Some time back he wrote on the same topic of [writing & writing regularly](https://medium.com/@vaidy/my-dance-with-writing-de8a16f67320#.aenk2g56n).

Taking wind of these cues, somehow today I got the inspiration to get on top of my instant gratification monkey and start this blog using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
Now the question comes - what am I going to write? I am not sure, frankly, but I feel I have to write at least once a week. I expect programming will be the most written topic. I really enjoy and aspire to learn new stuff in programming - be it techniques or languges or frameworks. By putting them in words I hope I can solidify those learnings and keep them fresh in my mind and writing about the learnings hopefully will give a sense of direction in my learning path.

Let's see how this is going to take off!

Btw, some years back I used to write [randomly](https://arunsark.wordpress.com/) which got broken some four years back. Let us hope this streak is going to be continuous and with regular cadence.

Happy writing to me!!
